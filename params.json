  "body": "As is known most researchers in Applied Machine Learning are doing image processing, natural language processing (NPL) or speech (acoustics) processing. Many find Machine Learning useful in analysing biological data, and so, Bioinformatics has been on the rise with the development of Machine Learning, which also saved numerous PhD students in Biology from being unemployed. The guys in Wall Street think it is super cool and sexy to combine Machine Learning in the trading strategies, so we see more and more  Artificial Intelligence (AI) hedge funds these years.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Machine Learning has become a versatile tool. So can we ask ourselves, is it possible to apply Machine Learning to solve fundamental research problems? Before we come to those tedious and boring technical details, we should have a look at these three questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is Machine Learning?\r\n\r\n2. Why use it at all ?\r\n\r\n3. How should I improve my Machine Learning skills?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n1. What is Machine Learning？\r\n\r\nMachine Learning has many titles and definitions, such as pattern recognition, statistical learning, data science, non-parametric models and so on. But there are two major features that describe Machine Learning. First, it is a class of data-driven algorithms. Secondly, the performance can be automatically improved with experience. Basically any methods satisfying the two features can be viewed as Machine Learning methods. The main functions of Machine Learning include regression, classification, clustering and probability estimation.\r\n\r\nRegression refers to the the prediction of some variable (the target) given a series of other variables (the input). It is worth noting that unlike the strict statistical definition, the target is not required to be the dependent variable, and the input are not limited to independent variables, though for most Machine Learning algorithms, a clear dependent-independent relationship can boost the performance remarkably. In other words, the target and the input are only assumed to be correlated. It is our machines' job to find out the hidden patterns. Some examples of regression includes using the historical price of a stock to predict its future price, or estimating the time to failure (TTF) of a structure based on its mechanical states.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, classification also tries to map the relationship between the input and the target. The only difference is that now the target is not a continuous variable, but a class. Classification problems are actually quite common in business and engineering fields. For instance, e-commerce websites recommend products to you based on your searching behaviours; Google's Deep Learning Network can identify the cats via pictures; the weather forecast tell you whether it will rain or not tomorrow. A simple classification sometime is more practical than regression. In addition, since there exist a label for each sample in regression and classification, they both belong to supervised learning methods.\r\n\r\nUnlike regression or classification, clustering is an unsupervised learning method, which means no labels are associated with them. The main goal of clustering is to group the data into several clusters, in order to turning the complex data into a simpler or more organized structure.\r\n\r\nProbability estimation, however, is not a popular topic compared to the above functions, but it is still quite essential in some fields. For example, the reliability analyst is often required to calculate the probability distribution of a structure's residual life. If the probability of that a structure's residual life is less than one year is around 40%, sometimes it is dangerous enough to trigger the alarm. But the result provided by the classification or regression is not detailed enough for such considerations.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, Machine Learning is a class of self-improving, data-driven algorithms for reason and prediction.\r\n\r\n2. Why use Machine Learning\r\n\r\nMachine Learning seems to be the answer to all problems. Strictly speaking, Machine Learning is able to answer all, but cannot viewed as a good solution for some problems. So far there are some Machine Learning methods which can predict the failure behaviour of materials much more accurately than very experienced experts, does that mean all the material scientists, and mechanical scientists should abandon their time-consuming experiments and turn to computers? The answer is NO. For most research topics, a deep understanding of the mechanism which explains the causal relation completely is still the most important thing. What Machine Learning does is to produce the reliable predictions given all the available information, rather than offer a solid mechanism.\r\n\r\nNow it sounds Machine Learning is a public enemy of fundamental research, but the truth is, Machine Learning can be a powerful team player for your research, as long as your research topic meets the one of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. A fundamental mechanism of your research topic has not been uncovered.\r\n\r\n2. The experiments for discovering the mechanism requires a crazy long time or too many variables, and often you do not know the variables are independent of each other or not.\r\n\r\n3. You are not able to collect all the true information you want from your experiments.\r\n\r\n4. Randomness is involved in the your experiments and you are not able to remove it.\r\n\r\nIt is quite easy for most students in fundamental research to meet the first condition. But for some students in Applied Physics, if the theories in their fields have developed maturely, Machine Learning will become a meaningless tool. The other three conditions are nightmares to most students. Say, if you are going to design the experiment to discover the failure mode of a structure in various environments, and then you find literature reviews say the average failure time for this structure is ten years. Don't worry, we can accelerate the experiments in the lab and use orthogonal experiments design to save time. Sooner you will find that you cannot simulate the environment well or get reliable results in the lab because there are too many possible variables that need to be taken into consideration. All right, you decide to take the work back to the field, and find you cannot even collect data or accelerate the process...\r\n\r\nAnd now it is time to have a trade with the devil, who wants so bad to help you build quick models and produce reliable predictions. But he wants you to sell one thing to him, the data, which is actually the soul for some people, or maybe for most of us. Nowadays the publisher encourages you to upload everything as supplemental materials, but a few authors share data. This is quite understandable, because we need papers to graduate, to secure a job, or to get promoted. Sharing data is like committing a suicide. However, sometimes a little sacrifice can bring a lot benefits to you, and even to the discipline. This will be discussed in detail in another article.\r\n\r\n3. How to learn Machine Learning\r\n\r\nAs is mentioned above, Machine Learning algorithms are like the rocket engine, and data acts as the fuel, both of which are essential to get a good performance. However, algorithms study is not a main focus for many students in fundamental research. Many people describe a data scientist as someone who knows maths better than a programmer and programs better than a mathematician.  That is actually a joke, and the funny part is that it is actually very true. Essentially, mathematics and programming can be the basis of Machine Learning. So far hundreds of algorithms have been developed, and the number is still growing. So how can I know which algorithms suit my project? Well, it depends on a lot things, such as the data, the problem you want to solve and the results you want to obtain. A good start is to refer to the Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet made by Microsoft Azure (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/machine-learning-algorithm-cheat-sheet/), or other similar cheat sheets.\r\n\r\ncheatsheetsmall\r\n\r\nOnce you are clear with which algorithm you want to use, the next step is put your data into the algorithm. There are  a lot libraries and packages which have already built a lot algorithms for you. For example, MATLAB has several Apps which can meet many popular algorithms. Most of the apps does not even need you to code. If you do not want to purchase MATLAB, then Scikit-Learn will be another good choice. It is an open source Python package which allows you to build the models more freely.\r\n\r\nIt seems that now we are well prepared to use Machine Learning. However, if you want to be a qualified data scientist, knowing the use of some software or packages is far from enough. From now on, you have to force yourself to be a pure mathematician. That means, you have to understand the mathematics behind the algorithm, and write the algorithm if possible. This is actually quite essential if you want to be competitive in this field. Moreover, for Deep Learning, one of the most popular topics these years, a solid and systematic theory has not been developed. Which model should I use? How many layers? How to connect each layers? Which activation function to use? How to optimize parameters? You cannot find answers without a clear understanding of the mathematics behind the algorithms.\r\nPersonally, PRML (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning), ESL (The Elements of Statistical Learning), MLAPP (Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective) are three Bibles for Machine Learning. In addition, the required mathematics vary from one algorithm to another. So you need to find the corresponding mathematical sources whenever you are feeling stuck. And it is always helpful to read the source code of algorithms, or try to write one.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, before you use Machine Learning, ask yourself whether it suits your project based on the four conditions (Another simpler way is is to search for the related publication by Google Scholar). And if you decide to be a data scientist, you need mathematics and programming to build the skill tree.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to choose algorithms for Microsoft Azure Machine Learning; Brandon Rohrer.\r\nWhat – Why – How; Stefany Maldonado.\r\n",
